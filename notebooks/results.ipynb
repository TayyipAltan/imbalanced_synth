    "# \"Should you use synthetic data for label balancing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After having worked with tabular synthetic data for the past 6 months, I have encountered many articles claiming that synthetic data is the solution for many (machine learning) problems. While synthetic data can serve as a useful Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) and has shown to be useful in certain tasks, its usefulness and relevance is not always clearly assessed. An example of this is, and also the inspiration for me writing this article, is the article provided by Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) titled: \"Can you use synthetic data for label balancing?\" (https://sdv.dev/blog/synthetic-label-balancing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The article addresses a well-known issue in classification problems: imbalanced target labels. The article correctly identifies techniques like Random Oversampling (ROS) and noise injection while acknowledging their downsides (being overfitting and noisy data). However, the article then presents synthetic data as a \"compelling solution\" without providing enough evidence of this. While I am a fan of SDV, their generators, preprocessors, and constraints, this article overlooks important aspects validating the validity of synthetic data for these problems. Although you definitely can use synthetic data for label balancing (to answer the question of the article), the key question is whether you **should** use synthetic data and how it compares to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this article, I aim to provide an answer to this question by comparing synthetic data produced by SDV generators against alternatives and build on top of the aformentioned article. Specifically, I compare data-level approaches such as noise injection, ROS, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE), and CTGAN against the algorithm-level approach of Cost-Sensitive learning. This idea is not novel and adjacent research is available in literature. Adiputra and Wanchai (2024) for instance compare similar approaches resampling and synthetic data approaches. However, their calidation approach uses cross validation while resampling before cross validation, which is a common pitfall leading to data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article aims to improve on this by providing a more methodologically sound approach whilst providing the intuition and explanation for practictioners that are less familiar with imbalanced classification problems."

    "It becomes evident that the dataset is highly imbalanced, with  only 0.17% of transactions being fraudulent. This can be problematic for machine learning algorithms if you were to not account for this as models tend to bias towards the non-fraudulent cases given their overrepresentation in the data. As a result, a model predicting every transaction to be non-fraudulent would already result in a 99% accuracy even though every fraudulent transaction has been wrongfully predicted. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting evaluation metrics, as accuracy alone can be misleading in imbalanced classification problems."
